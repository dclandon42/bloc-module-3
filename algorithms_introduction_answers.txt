Exercises

1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

~Making coffee~
Grind coffee beans till texture is fine.
Add ground coffee beans to filter
Insert filter into top of coffee maker
Add water till full
Wait till coffee fills up pot
If pot is full then
pour cup of coffee.


~Washing dishes~
Open dishwasher
Put all medium-small dishes on the top rack
Put all large dishes on the bottom rack
Put all utensils in basket
When dishwasher is full then 
Add soap then
start the dishwasher.

A choice of your own.
~Watering a plant~
Feel soil
If soil is wet 
Do not add water
If soil is dry Then
add water Then
When water comes out of soil
Stop watering.



2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

Netflix: Out competes because their instant viewing and lack of commercials solved problems with watching cable television and their wide selection out competes other streaming services.

Amazon: Amazons options for products make it easier than competitors to find anything you are looking for. The easy returns and free shipping makes it more efficient to use than competitors.

Starbucks: Starbucks' consistency outcompetes more local or fluctuating competitors. Their accessibility in locations makes it easier for them to build a customer base.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

I think an efficient algorithm is not only one that solves the problem, but solves it in the most desirable method. There are lots of online stores, but it is amazons ease and selection that makes it the top of its game. What makes one efficient is not only whether it solves the problem, but how simply and effectively it solves the problem.
