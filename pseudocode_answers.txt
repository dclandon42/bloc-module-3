Short Answer
  1.Why do programmers use pseudocode?
	A: Programmers use pseudocode to explain code in a language meant for people or programmers instead of computers or machines.

  2.If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
	A: Likely nothing would happen, or an error would return.

Programming Assignment
	1. Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

	Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

INPUT first number
INPUT second number
CALL greaterNum WITH numbers
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE if the second number is greater than the first number THEN
  PRINT second number
ELSE 
  PRINT "equal"
END IF

function greaterNum(a, b){
  if(a>b){
    console.log(a)
  }else if(a<b){
    console.log(b)
  }else{
    console.log("equal")
  }
}



	2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

CALL numbers WITHOUT INPUT
FOR every time the number is less than 101
  START at 1
  ADD 1 to numbers total
END FOR
RETURN EVERY iteration of numbers

function numbers(){
  for(i=1;i<101;i++){
    console.log(i)
  }
}

	3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

CALL search and INPUT a string
FOR every number less than the length of phoneBook
  START at the first item in the phoneBook array
  ADD 1 to the index
  RETURN the full item corresponding to the index
END FOR
RETURN "contact not found" if the INPUT string does not match an item in phoneBook
  


var phoneBook = [
  {name:"John Doe", address:"123 street", phone:"908-848-5578"},
  {name:"Mimi Flout", address:"889 Ave", phone:"909-832-8838"},
  {name:"Jenn Lee", address:"446 Blvd.", phone:"104-334-9524"}
];

function search(lookupName){
  for(i=0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
  if(lookupName == phoneBook[i].name){
    return(phoneBook[i].name+", "+phoneBook[i].address+", "+phoneBook[i].phone);
    }
  }
            
  return "contact not found"
}
     
console.log(search("Jenn Lee"))
